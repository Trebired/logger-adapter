# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve `@trebired/logger-adapter`.

## Development Setup

```sh
bun install
```

The package is authored in TypeScript and published from `dist`. Generated outputs, package tarballs, temp folders, logs, and caches stay out of Git.

## Common Commands

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bunx @trebired/code-discipline check
bun run typecheck
bun run build
```

There is no package test script. Committed `*.spec.ts` and `*.spec.tsx` files are banned by Code Discipline.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Keep public API changes intentional and documented in `README.md`.
- Run Code Discipline, typecheck, build, and package verification when present.
- Run the available package checks before publish work.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the current version or a new version section.
- Do not commit `dist`, package tarballs, temp folders, logs, or caches.

## Code Discipline

- Keep the config at `.code-discipline/config.ts`.
- Use `syncImports.output.type: "alias-map"`.
- Keep `allowRelative: ["./"]`.
- Do not add rule-level excludes to bypass discipline.
- Keep `@trebired/code-discipline` in `devDependencies`.
- Keep hardcoded `trebired` strings out of source files unless the package config explicitly allows the file.

## Design Principles

- Keep the package focused on adapting logger calls, not storing logs.
- Keep `@trebired/logger` compatibility straightforward and explicit.
- Preserve a small internal log call shape: `level(group, message, metadata?)`.
- Support exact caller-controlled output shapes through custom adapters.
- Avoid external runtime dependencies unless they remove real complexity.

## Release Process

1. Update `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` together.
2. Run the verification commands from Common Commands.
3. Publish with:

   ```sh
   npm publish
   ```

`npm publish` runs `prepublishOnly`, which typechecks and runs the package publish verification path.
